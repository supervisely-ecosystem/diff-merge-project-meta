## Overview

Visually compare projects meta: tags and classes. Define how to merge them and how to resolve conflicts. New empty project will be created with merged classes and tags. Then you can use `Diff Merge Projects` app to merge images and annotations and place them to the project created by this application.

**Step 4:** Explore you data with interactive table: click on cells to access corresponding images and open them in labeling UI.

**Step 5:** App saves link to report to team files: `/reports/classes-co-occurrence/<project id>_<project_name>.lnk`. Link to generated report also available in task output column. 

**Step 6:** Stop application once you finished with it. App can be stopped from tasks list or from application UI.

Example of the results:
Stop from App UI  |  Stop from workspace tasks page
